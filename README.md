# PowerBI exercises
These PBI files are the results of the Udemy's course: ["Curso Power BI – Análisis de Datos y Business Intelligence"](https://www.udemy.com/share/101rEW3@LM2XD4P97wviJ_DajBhm_ZB3lj5E21_2kn72RemfCTgxwOe6X2QJBowc-CcclnvbNQ==/), by [datdata](https://www.udemy.com/user/datdata/).

The course consists of 5 main projects, each one more complete or complex than the previous one. In this way, the course explains the vast majority of tools that are available in Power BI:
- Connecting to different types of sources.
- Data cleaning and transformation with Power Query.
- Creating charts, tables and other visualizations that work together with slicers to provide richer and easier data insights.
- Using of DAX formulas to enable even more custom and complex data transformations.

In this repository, I want to highlight the last 3 projects because they encapsulate most of the topics in the course. The last one is more focused on the DAX formulas, so the visuals are not well finished.

1. Project 1: 
2. Project 2: 
3. Project 3:
